    "# Web Components\n",
    "Software Componentization is a common practice in Computer Science. Following the principles of component-based software development (CBD), the software system consists of encapsulated sets of code blocks, which are self-contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle comes with the following advantages *(cf. [windriver](http://blogs.windriver.com/koning/2006/09/components.html), [Fu Cheng](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/build-mobile-apps/9781484237755/html/436854_2_En_3_Chapter.xhtml)):*  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Reduction of complexity:** small units of self-contained code are easier understood and thus easier maintained\n",
    "2.   **Increasing Flexibility**: plugging in a new component which does not depend on the other modules or the danger of breaking the code is drastically reduced\n",
    "3.  **Product reliability:** reusable components have to meet well-defined specifications, which forces a mature design\n",
    "4.  **Shorten the time-to-market:** components are reused in new projects, which accelerates the development process and lowers cost\n",
    "5. **Increasing collaboration and separation of concerns**: the components can be shared across teams. Different expertized development teams can work on specific specialized topics in a more accurate  manner\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to other popular programming platforms such as Java, Ruby or Python, which all have their own component ecosystem, standardized, reusable components across all web sites can only rarely be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the CBD principle on the web, the set of web platform APIs used are bundled in the [web components specification](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction). These components work across modern browsers and can be used with any JavaScript library or Framework that works with HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four main specifications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custon Elements:** These elements extend HTML tags such as `<div><span><p>` with custom defined tags. They must contain a hyphon `<custom-element>`.\n",
    "2. **Shadow DOM:** This standard makes it possible to encapsulate HTML markup, styling and functionality.\n",
    "3. **ES Modules:** defines the reuse of modular JavaScript\n",
    "4. **HTML Template:** is the declaration of markup fragments, which only will be instantiated at runtime, not at pageload\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the web, today popular frameworks such as Angular, React or Vue are used, all having their own component models. However, different developers and teams prefer to work with different frameworks, the components can not be easily exchanged. Furthermore, the components are not naturally encapsulated or self-contained, which may result in large, complex and difficult manageable web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter the creation of web components is compared to the traditional creation of components on the web.  \n",
    "Furthermore, since following the specifications of the low level APIs from the web components specification is verbose, libraries and frameworks add consistency and aim to facilitate the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this matter a close look will be put at the famous library Polymer, and the two frameworks Vue.js and Angular.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this analysis a simple Progress Bar component is analyzed, and in the second part a more complex Image Slider component will be investigated.\n",
    "\n"
